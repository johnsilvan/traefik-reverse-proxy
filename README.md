## Deploying on a public server with a real domain 
    Let's say you have a domain example.com and it's DNS records point to your production server. Just repeat the local deployment steps, but don't forget to update DOMAIN, EMAIL and CERT_RESOLVER environment variables. In case of example.com, your .env file should have the following lines:

   ```
   DOMAIN=example.com
   EMAIL=your@email.com
   CERT_RESOLVER=traefik
   ```
   Setting correct email is important because it allows Letâ€™s Encrypt to contact you in case there are any present and future issues with your certificates.
